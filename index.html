Lewandowski, for example, knows he cannot trust people the way he used to be able to. He has had to learn from his experiences.“There have been many attempts of dishonesty,” he says.
                                    “Even fake charity proposals. The number of strange offers is absolutely astonishing and, because of that, I have become distrusting of people. No one becomes my friend in one day. I have many doubts and my first thought

Having already reached 19 goals in the league this season, Lewandowski has scored at least 17 goals in eight straight seasons. His first season at Dortmund,
                                    when he scored just eight, remains the only time he has failed to reach double-digits in his 12 Bundesliga campaigns.&nbsp;The case for him being the best number nine in the world is compelling."It is important for
                                    every striker and you need this feeling in your DNA," Lewandowski told DW, referring to a striker's goal-scoring instinct.</p>

In three of the last five seasons he has been the Bundesliga's top scorer. Part of the reason for that is his commitment to improving even when he's at the top, and
                                    that extends beyond just improving his movement, his weaker foot or his aerial ability."If you think you are the best in world, you are finished. You have to constantly strive to be better," he said."When I look at
                                    football now and 20 or 30 years ago, it has grown. Football is not only about the ball, it is also what you do in training, in the gym, because people want more all the time."</p>

Four goals for Dortmund against Real Madrid back in the first leg of the 2013 Champions League semifinal was one his most brilliant nights
                                    – and a game he admits changed him as a player. The&nbsp;five goals in nine minutes against Wolfsburg&nbsp;though was a moment genuinely befitting of the word unbelievable.</p>

"I didn't realize it had only been nine minutes. I scored one, then a second and a third. Okay. Then
                                    came the next one and the next one, but I remember that I could have scored one more, because we had another very dangerous situation. I think normally I have to convert&nbsp;this chance, but maybe someone wanted me
                                    to score five in nine minutes."Perhaps it's the striker's instinct that makes him so special to watch, something that he feels might be missing in Germany.</p>

"Because last season I didn't score in the quarterfinal and the semifinal because of my injury – because I was playing through pain for eight months. But when you see
                                    the season before and the five seasons before that, I scored a minimum of one goal in every quarterfinal and semifinal. This is the difference. People sometimes see what happened yesterday not what has&nbsp;happened&nbsp;in
                                    the long run.</p>

There were times when I just lost focus for a second and suddenly I was under a lot of pressure and couldn’t get away.”Those situations
                                    can be difficult, with some people capable of being rude or aggressive, especially fans of other teams. “Especially when they are under the influence of alcohol,” he says. “There is aggression, people giving me the
                                    finger, swearing at me, reminding me of bad games, telling me how I should play or live my life. I have had confrontations like this in restaurants, for example, but if it gets too heated, Marcin reacts.”</p>
